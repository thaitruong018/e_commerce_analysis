# E_commerce Analysis
## Purpose
The objective of this project is to utilize Brazilian e-commerce public dataset to apply variety of methods to get deeper understanding of e-commerce field.
## Dataset
[Brazilian e-commerce public dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) was generously provided by Olist, the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. Olist connects small business from all over Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract. Those merchants are able to sell their products through the Olist store and ship them directly to the customers using Olist logistics partners.  
This dataset has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil, and consists of nine tables which are connected with few common attributes.

## Approach
I attempt to answer the following questions, which are of interest to stakeholders:
1. Customer retention rate
2. Customer segmentation RFM
3. Customer lifetime value
4. Predict next month transaction
5. Sales forcasting
